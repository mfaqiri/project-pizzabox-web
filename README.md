# project-pizzabox-web

Summary: The web application is designed for use by a pizza store employee to record incoming pizza orders. It allows the creation of new pizzas recipes, expandable due to the ability to add new ingredients, as well as store location inventory management. The employee can also examine customer information, searchable by name, and examine the sort-able order history, including orders to specific locations and by specific customers. The business logic prevents a customer from ordering at the same location within two hours of their last order.
